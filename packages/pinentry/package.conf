NAME=pinentry
DESCRIPTION=The PIN-Entry package contains a collection of simple PIN or pass-phrase entry dialogs which utilize the Assuan protocol as described by the Ã„gypten project. PIN-Entry programs are usually invoked by the gpg-agent daemon, but can be run from the command line as well. There are programs for various text-based and GUI environments, including interfaces designed for Ncurses (text-based), and for the common GTK and Qt toolkits.
